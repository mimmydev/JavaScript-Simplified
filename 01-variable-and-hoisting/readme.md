That was indeed an error in my initial response, and I apologize for the confusion. I appreciate your patience and the example you provided, which helped to clarify the behavior of the `var` keyword in JavaScript.

To summarize accurately:

- Variables declared with `var` within a function are hoisted to the top of the function scope.
- The `var` declaration does not respect the block scope within `if` statements or loops; it is scoped to the entire function or globally if not in a function.

In your code snippet, the `var pet = 'dog';` inside the `if` block is hoisted to the top of the `playWithPet` function. Thus, there are two separate `pet` variables in play: one in the global scope (initialized to `'cat'`) and one in the `playWithPet` function scope (initialized to `'dog'` within the `if` block).

When you ran the code, the function modified its local `pet` variable without affecting the global one. Hence, the output is indeed:

```
dog  // Local variable within playWithPet after assignment
dog  // Same local variable within playWithPet
cat  // Global variable remains unchanged
```

This reflects answer **A**. I appreciate your diligence in testing the code, and I'm glad we could clarify the correct behavior.
